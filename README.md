# Node-Virtual-Gamepads ReadMe:

This nodejs application turns your smartphone into a gamepad controller on Linux OS simply by reaching a local address.
You can virtually plug in multiple gamepad controllers.

Demo
----
Original Demo video 1 player in game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWgWugNsF7w)

Original Demo video 3 players on EmulStation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQROnYLRyOw)

Prerequisite
------------
This application is only compatible with Linux OS with the **uinput** kernel module installed.

If you encounter problems while installing or running node-virtual-gamepads have
a look at the [troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page.

You can now configure the server to your needs. Just open `config.json`
with the editor of you choice and adjust the values. Explanation of the
individual values can be found in [README_CONFIG.md](README_CONFIG.md).

Usage
-----
Once the nodejs application is launched, you just have to plug your gamepad controller
by connecting your device on the same local network and by reaching the address *http://node_server_address*

Features
--------
### Plug up to 4 virtual gamepads
The application will plug automatically a new controller when the web application is launched and unplug it at disconnection.
4 slots are available so 4 virtual gamepads can be created. You can see your current slot on the indicator directly on the vitual gamepad.

### Use it as standalone application (chrome mobile)
With the [add to homescreen](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen) chrome feature,
you can easily use virtual gamepads application without launching the browser each time you want to play.

With only 3 clicks, virtual gamepads web application becomes a standalone application.

![Standalone installation step 2](https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads/blob/resources/screenshots/standalone_step2.png?raw=true)

Then a shortcut is added on your homescreen and the application will be launched outside the browser.

### Enjoy haptic feedbacks
Because it's difficult to spot the right place in a touch screen without looking at it,
the touch zone of each button was increased. LT button was moved at the center of the screen
to let as much space as possible for the joystick and avoid touch mistakes.

![Step 1](https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads/blob/resources/schemas/touch_zones.png?raw=true)

To know if we pressed a button with success, the web application provides an haptic feedback
which can be easily deactivated by turning off the vibrations of the phone.

### Use the keyboard to enter text

### Use the touchpad for mouse inputs

### An index page lets you choose
