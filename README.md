# Node-Virtual-Gamepads ReadMe:

This nodejs application turns your smartphone into a gamepad controller on Linux OS simply by reaching a local address.
You can virtually plug in multiple gamepad controllers.

Demo
----
Original Demo video 1 player in game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWgWugNsF7w)

Original Demo video 3 players on EmulStation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQROnYLRyOw)

Prerequisite
------------
This application is only compatible with Linux OSes with the **uinput** kernel module installed, Which most of them do. 

This is only supposed to work in Linux and linux only. It isn't intended for other OSes

If you encounter problems while installing or running node-virtual-gamepads have
a look at the [troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page.

You can now configure the server to your needs. Just open `config.json`
with the editor of you choice and adjust the values. Explanation of the
individual values can be found in [README_CONFIG.md](README_CONFIG.md).

Usage
-----
```bash 
   
   ./run.sh # execute inside the directory

```

Features
--------
### Plug up to 4 virtual gamepads
The application will plug automatically a new controller when the web application is launched and unplug it at disconnection.
4 slots are available so 4 virtual gamepads can be created. You can see your current slot on the indicator directly on the vitual gamepad.

### Enjoy haptic feedbacks
Because it's difficult to spot the right place in a touch screen without looking at it,
the touch zone of each button was increased. LT button was moved at the center of the screen
to let as much space as possible for the joystick and avoid touch mistakes.

> [!WARNING]
> The support in mordern controllers is a bit wonky, and needs to be worked on.

To know if we pressed a button with success, the web application provides an haptic feedback
which can be easily deactivated by turning off the vibrations of the phone.

### Use the keyboard to enter text

### Use the touchpad for mouse inputs

Developing
----------
Please read the [contribution guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md) first if you haven't already.

Clone this repository and install its dependencies with

    npm install

When you change something in a coffeescript (e.g. main.coffee) run

    npx coffee -c main.coffee

This will compile main.coffee to main.js which than can be run with node
(see [Installation](README.md#installation))
To compile all coffee files when ever they change run

    npx coffee -cw .

If you want do add a new keyboard layout please refer to [this file](CREATE_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT.md).
